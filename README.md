# CO2-effects-on-geophytes
Humans that inhabited the glacial refugia in the Cape Floristic Region are assumed to have harvested and
consumed plant underground storage organs (USOs) as an important carbohydrate source during the
Middle Pleistocene. Botha et al. (2020, this issue), and others have demonstrated the rich resource that
such plants might offer to early human gatherers. However, such studies do not correct for the likely
reduction in plant productivity and USO yields related to much reduced CO2 concentrations typical of
Pleistocene glacial periods. To assess the need for such a correction, we grew Oxalis pes-caprae, a species
harvested by the human gatherers, at a range of CO2 concentrations from glacial to current. Decreasing
CO2 concentrations to glacial levels almost halved the mass of bulbs produced, while biomass was
preferentially allocated to roots and shoots, which were not significantly decreased relative to plants
grown at current CO2 concentrations. This would have major implications for estimating the potential
calorific return to foraging effort, as modelled using anthropological data and assuming that USO yields
would be similarly affected. The model suggests that an almost doubled foraging effort would have been
required at glacial compared to current conditions. This highlights the need to consider plant growth
conditions and particularly atmospheric CO2 concentrations when extrapolating current anthropological
studies to the past, which could be a major gap in understanding human dietary preferences in glacial
conditions.
